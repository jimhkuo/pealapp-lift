    <!--<span class="lift:Time">now</span>-->
    <p>This little application demonstrates the logical synthesis from Peal policies.</p>
    <p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a
        Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now
        to scores that are non-negative. But we will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,
        and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration
        brings to this synthesis process.</p>
