    <p>The PEALT tool is a workbench for articulating and analyzing policies that aggregate trust evidence. Such policy-based evidence is then meant to inform decision making in a variety of contexts such as access control, policy making, and risk management. PEALT is implemented by Jim Kuo and the researchers on this project are Michael Huth and Jim Kuo.
        <br/><br/>

        The capabilities of the current version of PEALT are consistent with those detailed in the technical report

        We refer to this document in lieu of a user manual. Users should note that the tool will typically produce flawed results if used in an unintended input/task combination. We now describe these illicit combinations:
        <br/><br/>
        Usage constraint 1: explicit synthesis should not be used when any + policy occurring within an analysis contains some negative or non-constant score or when any such * policy has scores not in the unit interval [0,1]; it should also not be used when any min or max policy occurring in an analysis contains some non-constant score (negative ones are OK then).
        <br/><br/>
        Usage constraint 2: symbolic synthesis should not be used when any min or max policy occurring within an analysis contains some non-constant score (negative ones are OK then).
        <br/><br/>
        It is therefore safe to use explicit synthesis for positive, constant scores only. And it is safe to use symbolic synthesis for positive and negative scores when only + and * policies may have non-constant scores.
        <br/><br/>

    <!--<h3>Abstract</h3>-->
    <!--<p>This little application demonstrates the logical synthesis from Peal policies.</p>-->
    <!--<p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a-->
        <!--Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now-->
        <!--to scores that are non-negative. We will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,-->
        <!--and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration brings to this synthesis process.</p>-->
