<h4>Cheat Sheet</h4>

<p>
    The user guide for tool PEALT contains many complexities that are more a reflection of the history of tool development rather than of its present usage. A large part of that complexity stems from the availability of a more scalable code generation method for a highly restrictive fragment of the PEALT input language.</p>

<p>
  However, our experience of using PEALT suggests that this more efficient code generation technique, called "Non-negative, constant scores" in the tool, is not really needed when using the tool on practical examples. We therefore offer here a quick cheat sheet that should help in using PEALT quickly, reliably, and effectively: </p>

<ol>
<li> Always use code generation options, "General scores", never use code generation option "Non-negative, constant score" (unless you expressly want to experiment with this).</li>

<li> Using option "Non-negative, constant score" on Majority-voting sample may cause the used server to run out of resources even for small values of n, as resoure demand grows factorially in n.</li>

<li> Always use the method "Display results of all analyses in pretty printed form and perform independent certification of results" (unless you expressly want to study Z3 code generated for your PEALT input).</li>

<li> If you refer to a policy p in a score expression of some policy, you need to write "p_score" and not "p" there. Doing the latter will implicitly declare a new real variable p causing undesired aliasing.</li>

<li> Related to the last point, real variables that are used in score expressions must not contain spelling mistakes as these will not be detected; rather, a real variable with the mispelled name will be implicitly declared.</li>

<li> Only be confident in the value of a PEALT input and its analysis findings, if all found scenarios certified successfully; and if you did automated vacuity checking of all conditions on that input, and convinced yourself that the conditions that are always true and those that are always false have those properties for reasons justified by your PEALT input and modeling assumptions.</li>

<li> The parser for PEALT input is not very sophisticated. So some parsing errors may not give informative error diagnostics. And some parsing errors may be unexpected. For example, a score expression x*-0.2 is legal, as are 0.2*x, x*0.2 + 0.8, and x*0.2 +-0.5 (the latter means 0.2x - 0.5). Whereas x*(-0.2), 0.2*-x, and x*0.2 - 0.5 are not, for example.</li>

<li> Although comments begin with symbol "%", this symbol needs to be at the beginning of a new line otherwise parsing will fail.</li>

<li> In zone DOMAIN_SPECIFICS, there is no need to declare real variables that feature in some score expression in zone POLICIES; and there is no need to declare Boolean variables that feature in some rule in zone POLICIES. The code generation in PEALT will add such declarations automatically (and will not declare them again if you happened to declare them).</li>

<li> If you have a policy with more than one rule containing an uncertainty interval, make sure that no predicate occurs in two or more rules that have such uncertainty. Otherwise, the nondeterminism will be resolved in the same manner for the intervals of such a predicate within that policy, and this is very likely to be unintended in your modeling assumptions. Please consult the case study "BGP Reset Session uncertainties example" to see how one may disambiguate such predicates when needed.</li>
