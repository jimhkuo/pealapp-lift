        <p> The PEALT tool is a workbench for articulating and analyzing policies that aggregate trust evidence. Such
            policy-based evidence is then meant to inform decision making in a variety of contexts such as access
            control, policy making, and risk management. PEALT is implemented by Jim Kuo and the researchers on this
            project are Michael Huth and Jim Kuo.
        </p>

        <p>
            PEALT allows users to formulate conditions as the basis of decision making (be it online or offline), and to
            statically analyze such conditions with two principal aims:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> to determine whether specified conditions and the policies they contain meet expectations of how
                perceived or observed risk and trust influence decision making
            </li>
            <li> to validate that the expectations that users have do not have unintended consequences when expressed
                and enforced in such conditions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The tool PEALT is written to reflect the methodology of <strong>auto-interactive verification</strong>. This
            means users can rely on automated verification tools that provide easily comprehended feedback which may
            trigger subsequent automated verification. And this process would be repeated until users are satisfied to
            have captured conditions as desired.
        </p>

        <p>
            The input language for PEALT gives users two options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> to write policies whose scores are all non-negative and constant; users can then analyze conditions by
                clicking on the dark blue button "Non-negative, constant scores"
            </li>
            <li> to write policies whose scores may contain negative numbers, variables, products of constants and
                variables or uncertainty intervals; users then have to click on the light blue button "General scores"
                in order to analyze conditions.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The description of the available analyzes, of the parameters n, m, m_min etc. used in the Random sample
            buttons of PEALT, and of the Z3 code generation for the PEALT input language with non-negative, constant
            scores can be found in the paper
