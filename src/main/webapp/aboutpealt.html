    <h4>Abstract</h4>


    <p>The PEALT tool is a workbench for articulating and analyzing policies that aggregate trust evidence. Such
        policy-based evidence is then meant to inform decision making in a variety of contexts such as access control,
        policy making, and risk management. PEALT is implemented by Jim Kuo and the researchers on this project are
        Michael Huth and Jim Kuo.
    </p>

    <p>The capabilities of the current version of PEALT are consistent with those detailed in the technical report
    </p>

    <p>
        We refer to this document in lieu of a user manual.
        Users should note that the current version of the tool will typically produce flawed results if
        used in an unintended input/task combination.
    </p>

    <h4>PEALT usage constraints</h4>

    <p>We now describe the illicit combinations, which we want to automatically disable in future version of the tool:</p>

    <p>
        Usage constraint 1: explicit synthesis should not be used when any + policy occurring within an analysis
        contains some negative or non-constant score or when any such * policy has scores not in the unit interval
        [0,1]; it should also not be used when any min or max policy occurring in an analysis contains some non-constant
        score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
    </p>

    <p>
        Usage constraint 2: symbolic synthesis should not be used when any min or max policy occurring within an
        analysis contains some non-constant score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
    </p>

    <p>
        It is therefore safe to use explicit synthesis for positive, constant scores only.
        <!--can currently not be generated  -->
        <!--domain specific information contains complex features such as  quantification or functions.-->
        For symbolic synthesis, it is safe to use both positive and negative scores when only + and * policies have
        non-constant scores.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, pretty printed output is currently not available for inputs with domain specifics,
        and symbolic synthesis results. This problem will be rectified in due course.</p>

        <!--<p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a-->
        <!--Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now-->
        <!--to scores that are non-negative. We will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,-->
        <!--and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration brings to this synthesis process.</p>-->
