        <h4>Abstract</h4>


        <p>The PEALT tool is a workbench for articulating and analyzing policies that aggregate trust evidence. Such
            policy-based evidence is then meant to inform decision making in a variety of contexts such as access
            control,
            policy making, and risk management. PEALT is implemented by Jim Kuo and the researchers on this project are
            Michael Huth and Jim Kuo.
        </p>

        <p>The capabilities of the current version of PEALT are consistent with those detailed in the technical report.</p>
