<h4>Getting started</h4>

<p>
    PEALT input consists of text statements delimited by \n (NEWLINE) characters. The sections of the input
    are divided by keywords, POLICIES,
    POLICY_SETS, CONDITIONS, DOMAIN_SPECIFICS (optional), and ANALYSES. The details of the language grammar is
    documented in the aforementioned technical report. This guide aims to give some basic ideas to get users started.

</p>


<!--<h4>POLICIES</h4>-->

<p>
    Multiple input policies can be defined in section POLICIES. Policy has the format
    [policy name] = [operator] (<i>rule*</i>) default <i>th</i>. We explain the syntax with the aid of a simple example.
    A valid policy may be,
</p>

<pre>b1 = min ((q1 0.2) (q2 0.4) (q3 0.9)) default 1.0</pre>

<p>Here, b1 is the policy name, min is the operator, followed by zero or more rules in a pair of brackets. Each
    rule is a
    tuple of (predicate name, score).
    Finally, the statement ends with the "default" keyword and a default score (1.0).
    The names of predicates, policies, policy sets, and conditions are strings starting with a letter,
    followed by more
    letters or numbers.
</p>

<p>

    Predicates do not need to be declared. The Peal parser will read in a policy and automatically recognise the
    left
    hand sides of the rule tuples as predicates.

    A predicate is a boolean value, a true value means the associated score is applicable, otherwise it means
    the tuple has no effect in the container policy.
    If all predicates are false, then the policy is assigned the default score.
    If a predicate name appears in more than one policy, it simply means
    the same boolean variable controls application of associated scores in those policies.
</p>

<p>
    If the operator is changed to +, *, or max, the score of the policy is aggregated accordingly.
</p>

<p>
    Note that while violating this does not cause an error, the policy name should be unique. Internally,
    policies are
    held in a map with policy names as the key, thus the policies will be overridden by later ones of the same
    name.
</p>

<p>At the risk of spelling out the obvious, the above statement says b1 is evaluated to the minimum
    of all scores where the predicates are true. If all predicates are false, then b1 is assigned the default
    score 1.
</p>


<!--<h4>POLICY_SETS</h4>-->

<p>
    Policy sets aggregate the scores of previously defined policies. A policy set can simply be equal to a policy, or
    aggregation of two policy sets by max or min operator (binary). For example, assuming we have policies b1, b2, and
    b3, then we can do,
</p>

        <pre>pSet1 = b1
pSet2 = max(b1, b2)</pre>

<p>If we wish to express a nested structure, we can achieve this by referring to already declared variable,
    as the policy set operators are binary. For example,</p>

<pre>pSet3 = min(b3, pSet2)</pre>

<p>is the allowed input to express pSet3 = min(b3, max(b1, b2)), which is not allowed input syntax.</p>

<p>
    The domain specifics section contains Z3 specific code that will simply be appended to the end of generated code.
    It is users' responsibilities to enter valid inputs accepted by the Z3 SMT solver.
    And to ensure that Boolean predicates that occur in rules do not (in fact must not) be redeclared as Boolean
    predicates
    in DOMAIN_SPECIFICS if they are referred to in that part.
</p>

<h4>Supported conditions and analyses</h4>

<p>Supported analyses, conditions and their usage are documented in the technical report.
    This section gives examples of the supported formats.
</p>

<p>A condition definition has the format [condition name] = [condition content]. As previously alluded to, condition name is a string.
    Condition content is the truth value of some condition.
    Let q1, pSet1 be defined predicate, respectively policy set, and th is a (numerical) threshold value.
    Valid examples of condition content are:</p>

<pre>pSet1 &lt;= th</pre>
<p>pSet1 is less than or equal to th.</p>
<pre>th &lt; pSet1</pre>
<p>pSet1 is greater than th.</p>
<pre>q1</pre>
<p>the proposition q1 (as a condition).</p>
<pre>!q1</pre>
<p>the negation of the proposition q1 (as a condition).</p>
<pre>!cond3</pre>
<p>the negation of condition cond3.</p>
<pre>cond2 &amp;&amp; cond3</pre>
<p>the conjunction of cond2 and cond3.</p>
<pre>cond4 || cond5</pre>
<p>the disjunction of cond4 and cond5.</p>

<p>In this early alpha version of PEALT, the language grammar is quite restrictive.
    Every line can only have one operator (i.e., !, ||, and &amp;&amp;). For example,
    in order to express
cond8 = !q1 &amp;&amp; (cond1 || !cond2) (which is not a valid input), it is necessary to break
    down the single line expression into the following:
</p>

<pre>not_cond2 = !cond2
or_cond = cond1 || not_cond2
not_q1 = !q1
cond8 = not_q1 &amp;&amp; or_cond</pre>

<p>We are looking into improving the language in future versions of PEALT.</p>

<p>The format of an analysis is [analysis name] = [analysis type] [condition name].
    The list of supported analyses are shown below (? character is part of analysis type),
    hopefully their intentions are intuitive from the type names used:</p>

        <pre>analysis1 = always_true? cond1
analysis2 = always_false? cond1
analysis3 = satisfiable? cond1
analysis4 = equivalent? cond1 cond2
analysis5 = different? cond1 cond2
analysis6 = implies? cond1 cond2</pre>
<h4>Simple example</h4>

<p>Given the following input,</p>
        <pre>POLICIES
b1 = min ((q1 0.2) (q2 0.4) (q3 0.9)) default 1
b2 = + ((q4 0.1) (q5 0.2) (q6 0.6)) default 0
POLICY_SETS
pSet1 = max(b1, b2)
CONDITIONS
cond1 = pSet1 &lt;= 0.5
cond2 = pSet1 &lt;= 0.6
ANALYSES
name1 = always_true? cond1
name2 = equivalent? cond1 cond2
name3 = different? cond1 cond2
name4 = implies? cond1 cond2
</pre>
<p>this sets up two policies b1, and b2. Policy b1 gets the minimum of the scores associated with q1, q2 and q3
    when any of them is true.
    If q1, q2, and q3 are all false, then b1 = 1 (the default score).
    The score of b2 is evaluated in a similar manner, the only difference is that the score aggregation operator
    is changed to
    addition operator +.</p>

<p>Policy set pSet1 represents the combined score of b1 and b2 using the max operator.</p>

<p>Then we define two conditions, each asserting the score of pSet1 is less than or equal to some value.
    In our example, we compare pSet1 to 0.5 and 0.6.</p>

<p>Finally, we define four analyses, hopefully their intentions are intuitive from the operators used. We get
    these pretty printed results by clicking the "Display results of all analyses in pretty printed form"
    button.</p>

        <pre>Analysed results:

Result of analysis [name1 = always_true? cond1]
cond1 is NOT always true
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false

Result of analysis [name2 = equivalent? cond1 cond2]
cond1 and cond2 are NOT equivalent
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false
cond1 is false
cond2 is true

Result of analysis [name3 = different? cond1 cond2]
cond1 and cond2 are different
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false
cond1 is false
cond2 is true

Result of analysis [name4 = implies? cond1 cond2]
cond1 implies cond2</pre>

<p>We check that whether cond1 is always true, whether cond1 and cond2 are equivalent, respectively different. Lastly,
    we check if cond1 implies cond2. Whenever the outcome of an analysis can be supported by a model,
    such a model is provided in the output.</p>


<h4>PEALT usage constraints</h4>

<p>We now describe the illicit combinations, which we want to automatically disable in future version of the
    tool:</p>

<p>
    Usage constraint 1: explicit synthesis should not be used when any + policy occurring within an analysis
    contains some negative or non-constant score or when any such * policy has scores not in the unit interval
    [0,1]; it should also not be used when any min or max policy occurring in an analysis contains some
    non-constant
    score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
</p>

<p>
    Usage constraint 2: symbolic synthesis should not be used when any min or max policy occurring within an
    analysis contains some non-constant score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
</p>

<p>
    <!--It is therefore safe to use explicit synthesis for positive, constant scores only.-->
    For example, it is safe to use explicit synthesis for constant scores in the unit interval.
    <!--can currently not be generated  -->
    <!--domain specific information contains complex features such as  quantification or functions.-->
    Also, it is safe to use symbolic synthesis for both positive and negative scores
    when only + and * policies have non-constant scores.
</p>

<p>
    In this early alpha version of PEALT, the app will return no result if any stage of processing exhausts the system
    resource. For example,
    PEALT may produce no output if a model generated for <i>n</i> greater than 20 of majority voting is supplied.
</p>

<p>Additionally, pretty printed output is currently not available for inputs with domain specifics,
    and symbolic synthesis results. This problem will be rectified in due course.

<!--<h3>Abstract</h3>-->
<!--<p>This little application demonstrates the logical synthesis from Peal policies.</p>-->
<!--<p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a-->
<!--Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now-->
<!--to scores that are non-negative. We will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,-->
<!--and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration brings to this synthesis process.</p>-->
