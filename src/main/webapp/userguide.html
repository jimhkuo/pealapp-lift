        <h4>PEALT usage constraints</h4>

        <p>We now describe the illicit combinations, which we want to automatically disable in future version of the
            tool:</p>

        <p>
            Usage constraint 1: explicit synthesis should not be used when any + policy occurring within an analysis
            contains some negative or non-constant score or when any such * policy has scores not in the unit interval
            [0,1]; it should also not be used when any min or max policy occurring in an analysis contains some
            non-constant
            score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
        </p>

        <p>
            Usage constraint 2: symbolic synthesis should not be used when any min or max policy occurring within an
            analysis contains some non-constant score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
        </p>

        <p>
            <!--It is therefore safe to use explicit synthesis for positive, constant scores only.-->
            For example, it is safe to use explicit synthesis for constant scores in the unit interval.
            <!--can currently not be generated  -->
            <!--domain specific information contains complex features such as  quantification or functions.-->
            For example, it is safe to use symbolic synthesis for both positive and negative scores
            when only + and * policies have non-constant scores.
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, pretty printed output is currently not available for inputs with domain specifics,
            and symbolic synthesis results. This problem will be rectified in due course.</p>

        <!--<h3>Abstract</h3>-->
        <!--<p>This little application demonstrates the logical synthesis from Peal policies.</p>-->
        <!--<p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a-->
        <!--Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now-->
        <!--to scores that are non-negative. We will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,-->
        <!--and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration brings to this synthesis process.</p>-->
