        <h4>User guide</h4>

        <p>
            PEALT input consists of text statements delimited by \n (NEWLINE) characters. The sections of the input
            are divided by keywords, POLICIES,
            POLICY_SETS, CONDITIONS, DOMAIN_SPECIFICS (optional), and ANALYSES. The details of the language grammar is
            documented in the aforementioned technical report. This guide uses the sample generated by the
            "Constant-score sample"
            button to help explain the input syntax.
        </p>

        <h4>POLICIES</h4>

        <p>
            Multiple input policies can be defined in this section. A valid policy may be,
        </p>

        <pre>b1 = min ((q1 0.2) (q2 0.4) (q3 0.9)) default 1</pre>

        <p>Here, b1 is the policy name, min is the operator, followed by zero or more rules in a pair of brackets. Each rule is a
            tuple of (predicate name, score).
            Finally, the statement ends with the "default" keyword and a default score.
        </p>

        <p>
            A predicate is a boolean value, a true value means the associated score is applicable, otherwise it means
            the tuple has no effect in the container policy.
            If all predicates are false, then the policy is assigned the default score.
            If a predicate name appears in more than one policies, it simply means
            the same boolean variable controls application of associated scores in those policies.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the operator is changed to +, *, or max, the score of the policy is aggregated accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that while voilating this does not cause an error, the policy name should be unique. Internally, policies are
            held in a map with polcy names as the key, thus the policies will be overridden by later ones of the same name.
        </p>

        <p>At the risk of spelling out the obvious, this statement says b1 is evaluted to the minimum
            of all scores where the predicates are true. If all predicates are false, then b1 is assigned the default
            score 1.
        </p>

        <h4>POLICY_SETS</h4>

        <p>
            The rest of the guide will follow similar format...
        </p>

        <h4>CONDITIONS</h4>
        <h4>DOMAIN_SPECIFICS</h4>
        <h4>ANALYSES</h4>


        <h4>PEALT usage constraints</h4>

        <p>We now describe the illicit combinations, which we want to automatically disable in future version of the
            tool:</p>

        <p>
            Usage constraint 1: explicit synthesis should not be used when any + policy occurring within an analysis
            contains some negative or non-constant score or when any such * policy has scores not in the unit interval
            [0,1]; it should also not be used when any min or max policy occurring in an analysis contains some
            non-constant
            score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
        </p>

        <p>
            Usage constraint 2: symbolic synthesis should not be used when any min or max policy occurring within an
            analysis contains some non-constant score (negative but constant ones are OK then).
        </p>

        <p>
            <!--It is therefore safe to use explicit synthesis for positive, constant scores only.-->
            For example, it is safe to use explicit synthesis for constant scores in the unit interval.
            <!--can currently not be generated  -->
            <!--domain specific information contains complex features such as  quantification or functions.-->
            For example, it is safe to use symbolic synthesis for both positive and negative scores
            when only + and * policies have non-constant scores.
        </p>

        <p>Additionally, pretty printed output is currently not available for inputs with domain specifics,
            and symbolic synthesis results. This problem will be rectified in due course.</p>

        <!--<h3>Abstract</h3>-->
        <!--<p>This little application demonstrates the logical synthesis from Peal policies.</p>-->
        <!--<p>We explore how best to do the synthesis of logical formula that capture whether a-->
        <!--Peal policy evaluates below or strictly above some threshold. We confine our attention for now-->
        <!--to scores that are non-negative. We will consider the consistency of conjunctions of predicates,-->
        <!--and investigate what research issues and trade-offs such consideration brings to this synthesis process.</p>-->
