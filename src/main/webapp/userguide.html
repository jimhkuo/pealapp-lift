    PEALT input consists of text statements delimited with \n (NEWLINE) characters. The input is divided into
    sections by keywords POLICIES, POLICY_SETS, CONDITIONS, DOMAIN_SPECIFICS (optional), and ANALYSES.
    We illustrate this with the car rental risks example provided in the tool interface. It specified four policies:
</p>
<pre>POLICIES
% policy capturing risk of financial loss dependent on type of rented car
b1 = max ((isLuxuryCar 150000) (isSedan 60000) (isCompact 30000)) default 50000
% policy capturing trust in rentee dependent on type of his or her driving license
% trust score for 'hasOtherLicense' contains non-deterministic uncertainty and so is in [0.3,0.5]
b2 = min ((hasUSLicense 0.9) (hasUKLicense 0.6) (hasEULicense 0.7) (hasOtherLicense 0.4 [-0.1,0.1])) default 0
% policy that captures potential risk dependent on type of intended car usage
% this policy happens not to be used in the conditions below
b3 = max ((someOffRoadDriving 0.8) (onlyCityUsage 0.4) (onlyLongDistanceUsage 0.2) (mixedUsage 0.25)) default 0.3
% policy that accumulates some signale that may serve as additional trust indicators
b4 = + ((accidentFreeForYears 0.05*x) (speaksEnglish 0.05) (travelsAlone -0.2) (femaleDriver 0.1)) default 0
% the next policy is just defining a 'constant' -1, to be used as sub-expression in a policy set
b_minOne = + () default -1
</pre>

    <p>
    Note the use of "%" to insert comment lines into PEALT input. The predicate names 'isLuxuryCar' etc. do not have
    to be explicitly declared as predicates, their type is implicitly inferred through their occurrence in a rule.
    </p>


    <p>
    The scores within rules may be constants (e.g. 30000 in policy b1 above), negative numbers (e.g. -0.2 is policy
    b4 above), variables, or constants multiplied with variables (e.g. 0.05*x in policy b4 above). All variables
    within score expressions of rules are implictly assigned the type Real. Additionally, a score expression s may
    be followed by an interval [l,u] where l and u are constant real numbers such that l &lt;= u. For example, in
    policy b2 we have rule (hasOtherLicense 0.4 [-0.1,0.1]). The meaning of this score expression is that it can be
    any number 0.4 + z where z is in the interval [-0.1,0.1]. This models non-deterministic uncertainty of score
    expressions.
