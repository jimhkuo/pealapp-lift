        <h4>Simple example</h4>

        <p>Given the following input,</p>
        <pre>POLICIES
b1 = min ((q1 0.2) (q2 0.4) (q3 0.9)) default 1
b2 = + ((q4 0.1) (q5 0.2) (q6 0.6)) default 0
POLICY_SETS
pSet1 = max(b1, b2)
CONDITIONS
cond1 = pSet1 &lt;= 0.5
cond2 = pSet1 &lt;= 0.6
ANALYSES
name1 = always_true? cond1
name2 = equivalent? cond1 cond2
name3 = different? cond1 cond2
name4 = implies? cond1 cond2
</pre>
        <p>this sets up two policies b1, and b2. Policy b1 gets the minimum of the scores associated with q1, q2 and q3
            when any of them is true.
        If q1, q2, and q3 are all false, then b1 = 1 (the default score).
        The score of b2 is evaluated in a similar manner, the only difference is that the score aggregation operator is changed to
        mathematical +.</p>

        <p>Policy set pSet1 represents the combined score of b1 and b2 using the max operator.</p>

        <p>Then we define two conditions, each asserting the score of pSet1 is less than or equal to some value.
            In our example, we compare pSet1 to 0.5 and 0.6.</p>

        <p>Finally, we define four analyses, hopefully their intentions are intuitive from the operators used. We get
        these pretty printed results by clicking the "Display results of all analyses in pretty printed form" button.</p>

        <pre>Analysed results:

Result of analysis [name1 = always_true? cond1]
cond1 is NOT always true
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false

Result of analysis [name2 = equivalent? cond1 cond2]
cond1 and cond2 are NOT equivalent
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false
cond1 is false
cond2 is true

Result of analysis [name3 = different? cond1 cond2]
cond1 and cond2 are different
For example, when
q5 is false
q1 is true
q6 is true
q4 is false
cond1 is false
cond2 is true

Result of analysis [name4 = implies? cond1 cond2]
cond1 implies cond2</pre>

         <p>We check that whether cond1 is always true, whether cond1 and cond2 are equivalent, and different. Lastly,
         we check if cond1 implies cond2. Whenever an analysis is false, a counter example is provided in the output.</p>
