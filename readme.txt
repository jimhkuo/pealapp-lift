This is a Scala project, using sbt with sbt-idea plugin. The use of Intellij IDEA 13 is highly recommended.

To set up the development environment (assuming sbt is installed on your path, and you have obtained PealApp-lift source), from the command line, do the following from PealApp-lift directory,

1. sbt 
(This will set up and download all required dependencies)

2. gen-idea
(This sets up the necessary Intellij IDEA project files)

Then you can open the PealApp-lift project in IDEA 13 (with Scala plugin).
 
The web front end is built in Lift. The Peal processing engine is done in pure Scala, with the exception that the Peal input/Z3 output parsers are generated by ANTLR 3. The ANTLR grammar files are in antlr directory. You might be interested to look at project/PealBuild.scala to see the dependencies of various modules, and how PEALT is put together.

I tried to be as strict as I could in following TDD practice. Most of the classes (if not all) have testing counterparts. The intentions and behaviours should be demonstrated by the test cases, so I made a point to avoid comments in my code when possible.
