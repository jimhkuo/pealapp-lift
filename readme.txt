This is a Scala project, using sbt with sbt-idea plugin. I used the Intellij IDEA 13 IDE for
 development and it is highly recommended.

Assuming sbt is installed on your path, and you have obtained PealApp-lift source, to set up the 
development environment, do the following from PealApp-lift directory in the command line,

1. sbt 
(This will set up and download all required dependencies)

2. (within the sbt shell) gen-idea
(This sets up the necessary Intellij IDEA project files)

Then you can open the PealApp-lift project in IDEA 13, make sure the Scala plugin is installed.
 
The web front end is built in Lift web framework, but most of the processing engine is developed in 
pure Scala. The exception from this is the Peal input/Z3 output parsers, which are generated by 
ANTLR 3. The ANTLR grammar files are in antlr directory. 

Once you get familiar sbt, you might want to look at project/PealBuild.scala to understand the 
dependencies of various modules in PEALT, and how it's put together.

I tried to be as strict as I could in following TDD practice. Most of the classes (if not all) have 
testing counterparts. The intentions and behaviours of the main classes should be revealed by the 
test cases, so I made a point to avoid comments in my code when possible. I guess my successor will 
tell me if I have succeeded or not.
